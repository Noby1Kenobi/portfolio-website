# portfolio-website
My website that showcases my skills and projects. Will act as my online resume to show recruiters.

To Dos:
- currently, technologies component looks very cluttered with each technology. make technologies its own constant just like projects so that the list item component and its children are not repeated over and over: {tag, [techs]} (example: {front-end, [react, bootstrap, materialsui]})
- Add intro sentence about me
- Add paragraph quickly talking about me
- move data in accomplishments to constants just like projects
- update projects to be my projects: social media clone, inventory project, fighting game, pong game, calculator
- change instagram button to itchio button
- change links for 'Learn More' button, navbar buttons, projects
- rename Acomplishment component to Accomplishments (correct any typos)
- repurpose accomplishment component into something else (if I can't think of something, then remove it)
