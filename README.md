# portfolio-website
My website that showcases my skills and projects. Will act as my online resume to show recruiters.

To Dos:
- currently, technologies component looks very cluttered with each technology. make technologies its own constant just like projects so that the list item component and its children are not repeated over and over: {tag, [techs]} (example: {front-end, [react, bootstrap, materialsui]})
- Add paragraph quickly talking about me
- move data in accomplishments to constants just like projects
- update projects to be my projects: social media clone, inventory project, fighting game, pong game, calculator
- change links projects
- rename Acomplishment component to Accomplishments (correct any typos)
- repurpose accomplishment component into something else (remove it for now, apply, then if I can think of something -> use it)
- think of slogan (remove it for now, apply, then think of putting in slogan)
