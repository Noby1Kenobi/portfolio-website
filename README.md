# portfolio-website
My website that showcases my skills and projects. Will act as my online resume to show recruiters.

To Dos:
- currently, technologies component looks very cluttered with each technology. make technologies its own constant just like projects so that the list item component and its children are not repeated over and over: {tag, [techs]} (example: {front-end, [react, bootstrap, materialsui]})
- repurpose accomplishment component into something else
- think of way to use slogan component
- change web icon (public/favicon.ico)
